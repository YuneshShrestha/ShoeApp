## Assumptions Made During Development

- Assumption 1: User will be anonymous whenever he/she post items to cart and review to item.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge 1: On the 5th day of development, Firebase was intermittently returning a List and a Map.
  - Solution: I used if else check if it is List or a Map to parse the data.

- Challenge 2: I don't have access to Firebase Blaze to run the Functions automatically
  - Solution: I have handled calculating the average rating at UI.

## Additional Features and Improvements

- Feature 1: Anaymous login

## Problems

- Due to tide schedule in this week I could not complete the whole UI part but I have completed all of the functionality. I am extremely sorry for incovinence.
